# mern-shopping-list
Shopping List created by MERN + React Redux using react hooks with Typescript

This Project is inspired by the udemy course of Brad Travesy https://www.traversymedia.com/.
Instead of using the class component approach I developed the project using functional components and hooks.
Used typescript react template for the development.
I added some validations and notifications which was not in the original tutorial
Thank you brad for the amazing tutorial.

please find the live demo of the application
